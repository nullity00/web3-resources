## DeFi

- [Hashflow](https://app.hashflow.com/dashboard) - DEX which uses market maker quotes rather than bonding curve
- [STFX](https://alpha.stfx.io/) - STFX lets you ride someone elseâ€™s trade. Rather than executing trades yourself, you give your money to someone and let them trade it for you.
- [Ferro Protocol](https://ferroprotocol.com/) - Trade Pegged Assets
